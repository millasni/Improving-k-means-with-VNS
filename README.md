# Improving-k-means-with-VNS
This was a term project for a course Algorithms for Optimization and Big Data Analysis at HEC Montreal. 
In this project, we code a k-means algorithm from scratch and improve it with variable neighborhood search (VNS). 

I add VNS algorithm to the basic implementation of k-means done by my teammate.
